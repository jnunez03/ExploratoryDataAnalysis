# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA for short)!

## Objectives:
1) Characteristics associated with people making "Phone Orders" (mobile).
2) Characteristics associated with people making "Cart Orders" (desktop).
3) Characteristics associated with non-conversions *AND* are they similiar to those who converted?

# Let's get started! This time with some useful graphs!
## First up: People who ended up making a Phone Order!
- They could have came from either mobile, desktop, or tablet, but the important thing is they *ended up* purchasing through mobile!
### Breakdown
![phoneconversion_where1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23710841/41639331-520000a6-742b-11e8-95e4-f7fbe0d3c843.png)
- This graph shows us a breakdown of people who made a Phone Order. What hardware they were using as well as how they got to the site.
- This also shows us that people who were already on their phones, stayed on their phones to make an order. People did divert to desktop, but mobile dominates.
- Paid search seems to do better on mobile!
- Totals: 191 Mobile, 144 Desktop (significant when compared with difference when people make cart order. We will see later.)
- Tablets? Yeah... at least 23 people made a phone order (we will take anything!).

- Totals on how many different pages were visited.. lets break this down even more. 2 page visits leads the bounty! (No, it's not because Derek Jeter wore that number, but everyone has their conspiracies).

- Mobile has the highest 1-2 page visits, with desktop increasing in that order.
- Desktop leads when 3 or more pages are visited. This leads to conversion on Phone Order (Don't Forget!).
- In other words, people on desktop wanted to visit more sites before making a phone order, whereas people who made a phone order already being on their phone saw less web pages! It took less pages for people on the phone to make an order!
## TOTAL: 358 Phone Orders. 191 came through mobile, 144 started at desktop!
## 1.77% total conversion given time frame of roughly 2-3 weeks in this data set (total of 20k+ entries)

### Let's quickly look at people who made a Cart Order! (Results: Not So Surprising)
![where1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23710841/41640781-ef8a32f6-7430-11e8-8ece-6854d2d9b042.png)
- Here is where we less less of a disparity between mobile/desktop despite this being a Cart Order Conversion!
- Many people were on the phone and decided to diverge to desktop to make a purchase.
- Paid Search did fairly better this time around.

- 2 page views leads again, but 3 distinct site views increased from when someone made a phone order.

- Despite being mobile/desktop, when people make a desktop cart order, they generally see more than 1 page!
## TOTAL: 305 Cart Orders. 144 Desktop, 137 started at mobile!
## 1.51% Conversion rate give time frame..

### Let's look at people who did not convert ....
