# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA for short)!

## Objectives:
1) Characteristics associated with people making "Phone Orders" (mobile).
2) Characteristics associated with people making "Cart Orders" (desktop).
3) Characteristics associated with non-conversions *AND* are they similiar to those who converted?

# Let's get started! This time with some useful graphs!
## First up: People who ended up making a Phone Order!
- They could have came from either mobile, desktop, or tablet, but the important thing is they *ended up* purchasing through mobile!
### Breakdown

- This graph shows us a breakdown of people who made a Phone Order. What hardware they were using as well as how they got to the site.
- This also shows us that people who were already on their phones, stayed on their phones to make an order. People did divert to desktop, but mobile dominates.
- Paid search seems to do better on mobile!
- Totals: 191 Mobile, 144 Desktop (significant when compared with difference when people make cart order. We will see later.)
- Tablets? Yeah... at least 23 people made a phone order (we will take anything!).

- Totals on how many different pages were visited.. lets break this down even more. 2 page visits leads the bounty! (No, it's not because Derek Jeter wore that number, but everyone has their conspiracies).

- Mobile has the highest 1-2 page visits, with desktop increasing in that order.
- Desktop leads when 3 or more pages are visited. This leads to conversion on Phone Order (Don't Forget!).
- In other words, people on desktop wanted to visit more sites before making a phone order, whereas people who made a phone order already being on their phone saw less web pages! It took less pages for people on the phone to make an order!

### Let's quickly look at people who did not convert! (Results: Not So Surprising)
